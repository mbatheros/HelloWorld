		<p>My name is Gedion Mutuku. I am final year student in Drafting Engineering and the reason this is my chosen career path is because I seem to have an insatiable appetite for creating things on the computer... a blueprint maze to me looks like an enticing novel. My personal goal for this semester is to achieve perfection in everything or come as close to it as I possibly can. I also plan to read and write as much as possible. At some point in the future i hope to write and publish a book. My goal is to start today working on it. For this year my goal is to graduate with honors and get a job in my chosen career. I read a lot and by read I mean listen to audio books (is that still considered reading?). I recently read the book 'The Forgetting' by Sharon Cameron and I must say it was one absolutely awesome beautiful piece. It made me think of how the would would be like if all humans had a reset button which would be activated periodically resetting all settings to factory settings. I think I can do things on a bike that most people would deem impossible.
